This program should:


- be written with python 3.5+ syntax


- recieve the NAO info about its own joint angles


- give this information to the trained ML agent and save its decision / action


- send the action to the computer communicating with NAO






NOTE: WHEN WRITING THIS PROGRAM PLEASE RE-UPLOAD TO THE GITHUB AS Controller_V1.py and increment as needed
